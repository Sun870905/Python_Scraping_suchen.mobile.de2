Is Python Correctly Installed?
You have to make sure Python is properly installed on your system. On Windows, open up the Command Prompt using Windows key + X and selecting Command Prompt. On Mac, open the Terminal using Command + Space and searching for terminal. On Linux, open the Terminal using Ctrl + Alt + T. Linux shortcuts may vary by distribution.

Then type:
python --version

On Linux, Python 3.x users may need to use:
python3 --version

If you get a version number (e.g. "Python 2.7.5") then Python is ready to go.

If you get a "Python is not defined" message, then you'll have to first install Python properly. That's beyond the scope of this article. The Python site has some detailed instructions for installation.

How to Install PIP on Windows
These instructions should work on Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10:

Download the get-pip.py installer script. If you're on Python 3.2, you'll need this version of get-pip.py instead. Either way, right-click on the link and select Save As... and save it to any safe location, such as your Downloads folder.
Open the Command Prompt and navigate to the get-pip.py file.
Run the following command: python get-pip.py

How to Install PIP on Mac
Modern Mac systems come with Python and PIP already installed. However, this version of Python tends to be outdated and not the best choice for serious Python development. It's highly recommended that you install a more current version of Python and PIP.

If you want to use the native system Python installation but don't have PIP available, you can install PIP with the following command in Terminal:

sudo easy_install pip
If you'd rather install a more up-to-date version of Python, then you can use Homebrew. Don't know what that is? Learn more about installing software with Homebrew on Mac. These instructions will assume you already have Homebrew installed and ready to go.

Installing Python with Homebrew is done with a single command:

brew install python
This will install the latest version of Python, which should come packaged with PIP. If the installation is successful but PIP is unavailable, you may need to re-link Python using the following Terminal command:

brew unlink python && brew link python
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to Install PIP on Linux
If your Linux distribution came with Python already installed, you should be able to install PIP using your system's package manager. This is preferable since system-installed versions of Python do not play nicely with the get-pip.py script used on Windows and Mac.

How to Install PIP on Raspberry Pi
As a Raspberry Pi user, you're probably running Raspbian since it's the official operating system designated and provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. You're free to install another operating system, such as Ubuntu. If that is the case you should look at the Linux instructions.

Starting with Raspbian Jessie, PIP comes installed by default. It's one of the big reasons to upgrade to Raspbian Jessie instead of sticking with Raspbian Wheezy or Raspbian Jessie Lite. However, if you're on an older version of Raspbian, you can still install PIP.

On Python 2.x:

sudo apt-get install python-pip
On Python 3.x:

sudo apt-get install python3-pip
With Raspbian, Python 2.x users should use pip while Python 3.x users should use pip3 when issuing PIP commands.
